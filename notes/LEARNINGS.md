# Learnings Log 🔁

**Keep this updated.** Newest entries at the top. One entry per learning — a gotcha, a
better command, a broken assumption, a demo-timing note, a tester's confusion. See the
learnings loop in [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) §7.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title
**Context:** what we were doing.
**Learning:** what we found out.
**Action:** what changed as a result (file updated, decision changed, task added). Link it.

## 2026-07-01 — Repo scaffolded and decisions locked
**Context:** First pass setting up the repo as the source of truth for the workshop.
**Learning:** Agreed the "all as code, focus in content" rule — the repo carries every
tooling variant (Terraform + Bicep, GitHub Actions + Azure DevOps, SQL projects + Flyway +
dbatools/dbops) but the taught content leads with **Terraform + GitHub Actions + SQL
projects**, covering **both Azure SQL and Fabric SQL** side by side. Site is **MkDocs
Material** → GitHub Pages.
**Action:** Recorded in [`decisions.md`](decisions.md) and [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).
Scaffold created; content still to be written (see [`../planning/tasks.md`](../planning/tasks.md)).

## 2026-07-04 — Canonical football schema built (men's + women's) as a SQL project
**Context:** First real code — building the canonical sample database (task #3) as the
content-focus SQL project.
**Learning:** Modelling **both the men's and women's game** cleanly falls out of a shared
`Club` that fields multiple `Team`s tagged by `Category` (Men/Women), with `Competition`
also carrying a category. One schema, both games, no duplication. Landed 9 tables, 3 views,
3 stored procedures + an idempotent, set-based post-deploy seed (PL + WSL played fixtures
with goals; El Clásico fixtures upcoming). Builds clean to a DACPAC with
`Microsoft.Build.Sql` (SDK-style) on `dotnet build`.
**Action:** Schema in [`../database/sql-projects/`](../database/sql-projects/); README
updated. Task #3 → DONE, #7 advanced. Runtime deploy not yet tested (no local SQL engine) —
see task #14.

## 2026-07-04 — Fabric SQL database ≠ Fabric Warehouse for T-SQL surface area
**Context:** Making sure the canonical schema deploys to both Azure SQL and Fabric SQL.
**Learning:** Our target is **SQL database in Fabric** (transactional, Azure SQL-compatible)
— IDENTITY, enforced constraints, indexes, views, procs all work. This is *not* the Fabric
**Data Warehouse**, whose T-SQL surface is far smaller (no enforced constraints, no
triggers, no indexes, IDENTITY behaves differently). Real watch-items for our target: no
TDE/Always Encrypted/ledger/in-memory, no spaces in column names, PKs can't be
`hierarchyid`/`sql_variant`/`timestamp`, no CDC.
**Action:** Documented in [`fabric-sql-notes.md`](fabric-sql-notes.md); referenced from the
`.sqlproj`. Grounded against Microsoft Learn.

## 2026-07-04 — Sample DB documented with a Mermaid ER diagram; CI builds docs on change
**Context:** Wanted an attendee page describing the sample database, with an entity diagram.
**Learning:** Material for MkDocs renders ```mermaid fences once you add the `custom_fences`
mapping (class `mermaid`) under `pymdownx.superfences` — no extra JS needed. `erDiagram`
gives a clean crow's-foot ER diagram from the schema. Verified with `mkdocs build --strict`
(catches broken nav/links) and confirmed the rendered HTML carries a `class="mermaid"`
block. Extended `ci.yml` with a **docs** job that runs `mkdocs build --strict`, gated by
`dorny/paths-filter` so it only runs when `docs/**`, `mkdocs.yml` or `requirements.txt`
change — the SQL-only PRs don't pay for it, and vice-versa.
**Action:** New page [`../docs/database/sample-database.md`](../docs/database/sample-database.md);
`mkdocs.yml` nav + mermaid config; docs job in [`../.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## 2026-07-04 — Pin the .NET SDK, or CI grabs the wrong one
**Context:** First CI run on the PR failed even though the SQL project built fine locally.
**Learning:** The `ubuntu-latest` runner had a **preinstalled .NET 10 SDK**, and
`dotnet build` used it despite `setup-dotnet` installing 8.0.x — `setup-dotnet` installs a
version but doesn't *force* selection. The `Microsoft.Build.Sql/0.2.0-preview` SDK can't
build under .NET 10 (missing NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack import). Fix: a repo-root
`global.json` pinning `sdk.version` to 8.0 (`rollForward: latestMinor`), so local and CI
resolve the same SDK. Also note: the pinned `actions/*@v4` now emit a Node 20-deprecation
warning (auto-forced to Node 24) — harmless for now; bump action majors when convenient.
**Action:** Added [`../global.json`](../global.json); CI green. Any `dotnet`-based job we
add later inherits the same pin.

## 2026-07-04 — CI to validate our own code; SQL static analysis keeps it clean
**Context:** Rob asked for a GitHub Action that checks all our code, growing as we go.
Jess flagged that moderator **Cláudio Silva** (perf expert) will notice smells.
**Learning:** SDK-style SQL projects run **T-SQL static code analysis** in-build via
`-p:RunSqlCodeAnalysis=true` (baked into the `.sqlproj` so it's always on). Combined with
`dotnet build -warnaserror`, any smell or model warning fails CI. Current schema: **0
findings**. Gotcha: from Git Bash the MSBuild `/p:` switch gets path-translated — use
`-p:` (or run under PowerShell).
**Action:** Added [`../.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) (database
build + analysis job today; terraform/bicep/docs jobs to follow). Code-quality bar added to
[`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) §4. Task #8 advanced.
